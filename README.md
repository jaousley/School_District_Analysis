# School_District_Analysis


## Overview of School District Analysis
The purpose of this project was to analyze a school district focusing on math and reading scores, budget per student, and standardized testing based on school type, school size, and grade. Gathering this data provides a clear picture of the top and bottom performing schools. The analysis was completed twice removing the reading and math grades for Thomas High School ninth graders due to suspicion of academic dishonesty specifically, reading and math grades for Thomas High School ninth graders. 

## Results

•	How is the district summary affected?

The district summary did not show a significant change when the Thomas High School ninth graders had their reading and math scores replaced with NaN. The overall scores and percent passing for each category changed by 0.1% at the most. 

•	How is the school summary affected?

Initially Thomas High School showed 90.94% for overall passing percentage. Once the ninth-grade scores were removed the overall passing percentage dropped to 90.63%. Still not a significant change so far. 

•	How does replacing the ninth graders’ math and reading scores affect Thomas High School’s performance relative to the other schools?

With and without the ninth graders’ math and reading scores in the analysis, Thomas High School comes second in the top five performing schools 

•	How does replacing the ninth-grade scores affect the following:
Math and reading scores by grade
  The only difference was “Nan” being shown for the ninth-grade scores. All of the averages were split by school and grade. Had the averages been split by grade across the entire district instead of specific schools there would have been an affect. 

Scores by school spending
  No affect

Scores by school size
  No affect

Scores by school type
  No affect

## Summary: 

There weren’t any significant changes from replacing the Thomas High School ninth grade scores with Nan. The overall passing percentage for THS dropped by only 0.31%. The average reading score went from 83.84 to 83.89. The average math score went from 83.41 to 83.35. The percent of students passing math went from 93.27% to 93.18%. Because the changes were so insignificant it didn’t make a difference in the data regarding school spending, school size, and school type.
